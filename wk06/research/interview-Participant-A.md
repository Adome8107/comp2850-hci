**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm creating/editing tasks, I want to add labels, so I can categorise and later filter tasks easily."
- "When I'm deleting multiple items, I want to be able to select multiple items/select a label, so I can delete tasks quicker."
- "When multitasking, I want to be read my tasks, their labels and due dates, so I can do other tasks while taking in this information."
